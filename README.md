<h2>JavaScript</h2>
It's my 1ยบ application in JavaScript, I followed the tutorial <To Do List App in JavaScript [beginners]> from CodeExplained, where a JavaScript beginner can be able to create a beautiful and functional to do list.

About the TO-DO List: 
<ol>
  <li>Beautiful UI </li>
  <li>User can add a to-do by filling the input and hit ENTER </li>
  <li>User can check the to-do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button </li>
  <li>User can clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app </li>
  <li>The list is stored in the local storage, so even when the page is refreshed the list is still there </li>
<ol>
